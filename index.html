        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I have spent the last few years utilizing the downtime the pandemic
          has provided in order to work on my skills as a software developer. I
          have found that focusing on sharpening my tools is a better use of my
          time then watching netflix or other hobbies that just waste time and
          opportunity.

        <h3>Windows PC are better than Mac</h3>
        <p>
          It is a very unpopular opinion on which pc is a better option. I
          believe it is a individual preference and for me I prefer a windows
          operating system over Mac OS.
