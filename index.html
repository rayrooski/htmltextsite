        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have spent the last few years utilizing the downtime the pandemic
          has provided in order to work on my skills as a software developer. I
          have found that focusing on sharpening my tools is a better use of my
          time then watching netflix or other hobbies that just waste time and
          opportunity.</p>

          <p>It is a very unpopular opinion on which pc is a better option. I
            believe it is a individual preference and for me I prefer a windows
            operating system over Mac OS.</p>
